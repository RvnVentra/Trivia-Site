# Trivia Site

This project was created as a refresher on basic React usage, learning animation and transition usage with Styled Components, working with React Router, React Helmet, and He.
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)
- [Styled Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components/v/4.1.3)
- [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
- [React Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet)
- [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he)
- [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/)

This project was built with the intention of allowing users to run the project to play a Trivia game. Upon launching the site, users will be brought to an introductions page for the Author with the option to view the Github of the website or to head towards the Trivia site. Once the user reaches the Trivia site, they'll be allowed to select one of many categories of Trivia's they wish to play. After a selection has been made, the button "Generate Trivia" will appear and allow users to fetch from an api consisting of many trivia questions relating to the selected category. From there on, the user can read the questions display and choose the answer they believe to be the right one and repeat for 10 questions total. Finally, the users will be showed their score out of 10 and be given the option to view the questions + answers they got wrong or return to Trivia page to select another category to start again.
